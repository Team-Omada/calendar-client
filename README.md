# calendar-client

Our client runs on port 8080, visit localhost:8080 to see the client! Register and Login should be working. Make sure to start the omada-server to check them out. Logging in or creating an account forces you to a /dashboard page where your only actions are to log out or sit there. Since you are logged in, you cannot visit the /register or /login routes!

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

This may take a bit to run for the first time.

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### VSCode Extensions

I would recommend downloading the ESLint and Prettier extensions to keep coding styles consistent! I would also recommend getting the Vetur extension which gives some helpful tooling when working with Vue.

### Commit conventions

Just to organize our commits a bit, we could just use the "feat", "fix", "chore" convention from this [guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
